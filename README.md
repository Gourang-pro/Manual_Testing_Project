# Manual_Testing_Project
The repository includes a well-defined set of test cases covering various aspects of OpenCart.

Key Features:

Test Cases: The repository includes a well-defined set of test cases covering various aspects of OpenCart, including user registration, product management, order processing, payment gateways, and administrative functions. Test cases are categorized by module and user role for easy navigation and execution.

Test Scenarios: Detailed test scenarios provide step-by-step instructions for replicating specific user journeys and interactions within the OpenCart platform. This facilitates consistent and efficient testing across different testers and ensures thorough coverage of key functionalities.

Expected Results: Every test case clearly defines expected results for each interaction. This helps testers identify bugs, regressions, and inconsistencies in OpenCart's behavior.

Reporting: The project encourages testers to document their findings using a standardized template. This includes logging bugs, screenshots, and detailed descriptions of encountered issues.

Target Audience:

This project is mainly for manual testing freshers, QA engineers, and software testing students who want to learn or practice testing an e-commerce application like OpenCart. It is also useful for automation testers as a reference for test cases and for anyone who wants to understand how real-time manual testing is done using clear test cases, scenarios, and expected results.
